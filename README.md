# CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship Tasks

This repository contains my completed projects for the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. I have successfully implemented 2 out of 4 assigned tasks as required.

# # Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Hangman Game
**File:** `hangman.py`

A classic text-based Hangman game where players guess a word letter by letter.

**Features:**
- 5 predefined words (python, programming, computer, keyboard, monitor)
- Visual hangman drawing that updates with wrong guesses
- Maximum 6 wrong guesses allowed
- Input validation and error handling
- Play again functionality
- Clean console interface with emojis and formatting

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Random module for word selection
- While loops for game logic
- If-else conditions for validation
- String manipulation
- Lists and sets for data storage
- Functions for code organization

**How to Run:**
```bash
python hangman.py
```

### Task 4: Basic Chatbot
**File:** `chatbot.py`

A simple rule-based chatbot that responds to various user inputs with predefined replies.

**Features:**
- Responds to greetings, questions about name/age, help requests
- Pattern matching using regular expressions
- Random response selection for variety
- Handles programming-related questions
- Graceful conversation ending
- Demo mode to showcase capabilities
- Input cleaning and validation

**Conversation Topics:**
- Greetings (hello, hi, hey)
- Personal questions (name, age, capabilities)
- Gratitude (thank you, thanks)
- Farewells (bye, goodbye, exit)
- Programming topics
- Weather (basic responses)
- Help and capabilities

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Object-oriented programming (classes and methods)
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- Random module for response variety
- Input/output handling
- Functions and loops
- String processing
- Conditional statements

**How to Run:**
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

##  Technical Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses only built-in modules)
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

##  Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I have demonstrated proficiency in:

1. **Core Python Concepts:**
   - Variables, data types, and operators
   - Control structures (if-else, while loops)
   - Functions and code organization
   - String manipulation and formatting

2. **Data Structures:**
   - Lists for storing game words and responses
   - Sets for tracking guessed letters
   - Dictionaries for organizing chatbot responses

3. **Advanced Concepts:**
   - Object-oriented programming
   - Regular expressions
   - Random number generation
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Pattern matching and text processing

4. **Software Development Practices:**
   - Clean, readable code with comments
   - Modular programming with functions
   - User-friendly interfaces
   - Error handling and edge cases

##  How to Test

### Hangman Game:
1. Run the program
2. Try guessing letters for the hidden word
3. Test with both correct and incorrect guesses
4. Verify the hangman drawing updates correctly
5. Test the play-again functionality

### Basic Chatbot:
1. Run the program
2. Try the demo mode first to see capabilities
3. Test various conversation starters:
   - "Hello"
   - "What's your name?"
   - "How are you?"
   - "Help"
   - "Goodbye"
4. Verify the bot responds appropriately to each input

##  Project Insights

These projects demonstrate fundamental Python programming skills and showcase the ability to create interactive console applications. The Hangman game focuses on game logic and user interaction, the Chatbot emphasizes pattern matching and conversational AI basics, and the Stock Portfolio Tracker demonstrates financial calculations, data management, and file operations.

All three projects include comprehensive error handling, user-friendly interfaces, and clean code structure that follows Python best practices.
